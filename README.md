## About
Liftoff is a advanced Julian's editor alternative akin to Scratch and can run anywhere; even a Wii. Whether you have little to no coding experience, or you are just super lazy, anyone can make anything* in Liftoff.

(Since anything can be made in Liftoff, we dare you to port the entirety of Doom to Liftoff.)
